  "body": "core\r\n====\r\n\r\nThe complete core Java software for the Transitime real-time transit information project. Transitime is a project created and managed by Swiftly, Inc. (www.goswift.ly).\r\n\r\nThe goal of Transitime is to use any type of real-time GPS data to generate useful public transportation information. The system is for both letting passengers know the status of their vehicles and for helping agencies more effectively manage their systems. By providing a complete open-source system, agencies can have a cost effective system and have full ownership of it. \r\n\r\nThe software is currently being used in a production environment for MBTA Commuter Rail and for several smaller agencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Build</b>\r\n\r\nThe software is made up of three modules which can each be built with maven. See BUILD.md\r\n\r\nThe core functionality is in the transitime project. The REST api is in transitimeApi and the user Web applicaton is in transitimeWebapp.\r\n\r\n<b>Setup</b>\r\n\r\nThe main module is transitTime. This has several standalone programs in the org.transitime.applications package.\r\n\r\nSchemaGenerator.java will generate the SQL to create the database structures you need to run on.<br/>\r\nDBTest.java can be used to test that the database can be connected to.<br/>\r\nGTFSFileProcessor.java will read a GTFS file into this database structure.<br/>\r\nCore.java is as the name implies is the workhorse of the system. <br/>\r\nRmiQuery.java allows you make queries to the server run in core from the command line.<br/>\r\nCreateAPIKey.java a test app to allow you create test/demo key to access REST api webapp.<br/>\r\n\r\nDetails on how to run each of these and their respective parameters are in the README for the transitime module.\r\n\r\nOnce this is set up the next step is to set up the transitimeApi which is a RESTful API. This API makes RMI calls to the RMI Server started by Core.java to provide results. This is a war file which can be deployed into Tomcat.  \r\n\r\nThe transitimeWebapp in turn is a web application which uses the transitTimeAPI to provided a user interface. This is a war file which can be deployed into Tomcat. This connects to the database and the connection information is configured in hibernate.cfg.xml in the src/main/resources directory. Currently this needs to be deployed on the same server as the API.\r\n\r\n",
